# colorGame
Project from my online course using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
In this game project, you are give randomly selected RGB numbers as well as colors then then you can choose what color best represents the RGB you're given.
You can also choose the difficulty level selecting from 6 randomly selected colors or 3 colors only.
I hope you have fun as much as I had making this game.
